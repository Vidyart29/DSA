A quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation of a variable say x. The general form of a quadratic equation is given as:
a*x2 + b*x + c = 0

Where a,b and c are real known values and,
a can't be zero.

Roots of an Equation: The roots of an equation are the values for which the equation satisfies the given condition. For Example, the roots of equation x2 - 7x - 12 = 0 are 3 and 4 respectively. If we replace the value of x by 3 and 4 individually in the equation, the equation will evaluate to zero.

A quadratic equation has two roots. The roots of a quadratic equation can be easily obtained using the quadratic formula:
roots = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a

Derivation:
ax2 + bx + c = 0

or, ax2 + bx = -c

or, x2 + (b/a)x = -(c/a)

or, x2 + (b/a)x + (b2/4a2) - (b2/4a2) = -(c/a)

or, x2 + (b/a)x + (b2/4a2) = -(c/a) + (b2/4a2)

or, (x + b/2a)2  = -(c/a) + (b2/4a2)

or, (x + b/2a)2  = (b2  - 4ac) /4a2

or, (x + b/2a) = ± √(b2 - 4ac) /2a

or, x = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a

There arises three cases as described below while finding the roots of a quadratic equation:
If b2 < 4ac, then roots are complex
(not real).
For example roots of x2 + x + 1, roots are
-0.5 + i1.73205 and -0.5 - i1.73205

If b2 = 4ac, then roots are real 
and both roots are same.
For example, roots of x2 - 2x + 1 are 1 and 1

If b2 > 4ac, then roots are real 
and different.
For example, roots of x2 - 7x - 12 are 3 and 4
